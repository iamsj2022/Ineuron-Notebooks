    "This document is intended towards helping all the data scientists out there. It is a step by step guide for creating a `Food Application`. In this case, a food application right from scratch and then it can be deployed in any cloud platform. This document takes a simple example of a food application process from scratch and as outcome it shows the entered data with respect to datetime. \n"

    "- The calorie is a unit of energy widely used in nutrition. The small calorie or gram calorie (usually denoted cal) is the amount of heat energy needed to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius (or one kelvin). The large calorie, food calorie, or kilocalorie (Cal, calorie or kcal) is the amount of heat needed to cause the same increase in one kilogram of water. Thus, 1 kilocalorie (kcal) = 1000 calories (cal). \n",
    "\n",
    "- By convention in food science, the large calorie is commonly called Calorie (with a capital C by some authors to distinguish from the smaller unit). In most countries, labels of industrialized food products are required to indicate the nutritional energy value in (kilo or large) calories per serving or per weight.\n",
