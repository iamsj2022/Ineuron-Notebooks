    "## 20.1 Memory Management\n",
    "**Overview **\n",
    "\n",
    "- Memory management in Python involves a private heap containing all Python objects and data structures. \n",
    "- The management of this private heap is ensured internally by the **`Python Memory Manager`**. The Python memory manager has different components which deal with various dynamic storage management aspects, like sharing, segmentation, preallocation or caching.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is important to understand that the management of the Python heap is performed by the interpreter itself and that the user has no control over it, even if they regularly manipulate object pointers to memory blocks inside that heap. \n",
    "- The allocation of heap space for Python objects and other internal buffers is performed on demand by the Python memory manager through the Python/C API functions listed in [official pyhton document](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/memory.html#:~:text=Overview,by%20the%20Python%20memory%20manager.).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** To avoid memory corruption, extension writers should never try to operate on Python objects with the functions exported by the `C` library: `malloc()`, `calloc()`, `realloc()` and `free()`. This will result in mixed calls between the `C` allocator and the `Python memory manager` with fatal consequences, because they implement different algorithms and operate on different heaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** However, one may safely allocate and release memory blocks with the `C` library allocator for [individual purposes](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/memory.html#:~:text=Overview,by%20the%20Python%20memory%20manager.). "

    "\n",
    "- In python, the threading process is considered to well-known approach to accomplishing concurrency and parallelism. Although, thread is a lightweight task/process and its feature generally provided via the OS (operating system). Thread shares the same space of memory as shown in below diagram.\n",
    "\n",

    "- If the multiple threads has been used by python application, you can see a single entry for a script while looking at running process on OS, while its running multiple number of threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When a program develop multiple threads with execution process is called multithreading, so that one running task does not block others task. It generally works better when a task is divided into subtasks, then each subtask is given to a thread for the execution. "
